    Hi! My name is Matthew Chernis. I'm 17 years old and from Westchester, New York. I love to play videogames. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As of now, I have learned:
    </p>
      <ul class= "list">
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      I chose to take this course because I wanted to learn more about these languages and learn new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      One website I visit frequently is:
    </p>
    <a href= "https://www.espn.com/"> ESPN </a>
    <p>
      I love to play sports. Here is a ranking of my favorite sports.
    </p>
    <ol class= "sports">
        <li>Basketball</li>
        <li>Football</li>
        <li>Badminton</li>
        <li>Soccer</li>
    </ol>
    <p class= "end">
      I look forward to learning more about computer science and web programming in the next week and a half!
